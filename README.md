embellir: *making beautiful that which you want to know*

![screenshot of version 0.1.2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbieh/embellir/master/doc/images/embellir-0.1.2.png)

## Usage

    $ java -jar embellir-0.1.2-standalone.jar 

Once running, embellir listens on port 9999. You can connect to that port and
issue commands as detailed in the protocol section below.

## How it works

Embellir has a data curator, which maintains data used for vizualizations. The
visualizations are generated by the illustrator. 

By way of metaphor, the curator manages 'curios' and the illustrator manages 'doodles'.

Currently there are curios for:
* Recent CPU load
* Current memory usage
* Calendar data (fetched via CALDAV)
* Weather conditions
* Weather forecast

There are corresponding doodles for CPU, memory, and current weather
conditions. There is also a polarclock doodle which combines a clock with
calendar data and an hourly weather forecast.

## Configuration

Embellir has an RC file which contains some basic configuration data. Most
importantly the GPS coordinate used for finding the local weather forecast.
There is also a startup file which uses the same protocol as the network
interface for initial loading of curios and doodles.

### $HOME/.embellir.rc

This is a standard Clojure hash-map. At the minimum, the location specification
is useful.

	{
	 :location {:lat 33.82 :lon -84.36}
	 :curios {}
	 :doodles {}
	 :startup {}
	}

### $HOME/.embellir.startup

Here is an example that will load a good default set of components.

curate forecast
curate weather
curate calendar
curate cpu
curate memory
illustrate polarclock
illustrate memory
illustrate cpu
illustrate weather
supply calendar {:owncloud-caldav {:protocol :caldav :calrc :owncloud-default }}
layout layout-central-feature

### $HOME/.embellir/embellir

You can put curios and doodles in this locatation under curios/ and doodles/ respectively.

Additionally, dependencies for doodles can be defined here. *todo: docs on this*

## Protocol

By default, port 9999 will be open. If it is taken, then 9998 will be tried.
You can use telnet to open this port, or netcat to send commands.

A quick list of samples:

	LAYOUT layout-tiled
	CURATE weather 
	CURATE cpu
	ILLUSTRATE polarclock 
	ILLUSTRATE cpu 
	ILLUSTRATE weather 
	SUPPLY curioname {:keyword "test" :text "this is a test\nmore test\nmore test"}

This will almost certainly change in the future.

## Aspirations

Maps tell you where you are in space.

Clocks tell you where you are in time.

I would like for embellir to simply tell you where you are.
