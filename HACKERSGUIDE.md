## The Model

There are three major components to embellir: the Illustrator, the Curator, and the Bit Dock.

The Illustrator manages a collection of doodles, which are functions to draw something on the screen using Quil. For example, a simple doodles might just write the current time to the screen.

The Curator manages a collection of curios, which are bundles of data along with functions to manage that data. The current weather for your area might be such a curio.

The Bit Dock handles TCP connections. A simple protocol allows for both feeding data to curios and directing the display of doodles.
